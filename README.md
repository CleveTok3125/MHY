# Notice of discontinuation of development
This is a personal experimental research project with the aim of finding a solution to reduce the size of the game update. Currently the code can still work, but the integration of too many features (and I messed up the code) makes it difficult to maintain. Instead, I developed [MHY-cli](https://github.com/CleveTok3125/MHY-cli) and inherited only some of the necessary features. The aim is to provide command line download capabilities for remote users. As for installing game updates, there are many alternative launchers to HoYoPlay, which are open source and more efficient.

## ⚠️Attention
- Although the new API is supported, the features are not yet fully tested. If you encounter any errors, please feed back in issue.
- Currently the audio patcher only supports Genshin Impact. For other games, download the client and audio zip file and update via launcher. **DO NOT COPY CONTENTS IN THE ZIP FILE DIRECTLY TO GAME DIRECTORY**.
- I'm working on an audio patcher for Zenless Zone Zero but it hasn't worked yet. To use the stable version, download it via [releases](https://github.com/CleveTok3125/MHY/releases)
